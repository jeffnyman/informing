This repository provides redistributable materials related to Inform to
facilitate its use. Inform itself is distributed under its own license,
and the terms and conditions of that license apply to the Inform software
and any associated materials provided here.

When I say "Inform" here that should be read as understanding Inform 6,
Inform 7, and any versions subsequent, along with supporting tools in the
Inform ecosystem, such as Inweb and Intest.

In terms of licensing for what this repository _does_ contain, all I'm
doing here is providing an understanding that this repository can be copied,
distributed, and so on as you see fit. But the contents of this repository
that are related to Inform itself still hold.

So let's be clear on what this means. The copyright for all things Inform
is held by Graham Nelson. On 28 April 2022, the Inform ecosystem was placed
