[Streams::] Streams.

Support for writing structured textual output, perhaps to the screen,
to a file, or to a flexible-sized wide string.

@h About streams.
The Inform tools produce textual output in many formats (HTML, EPS, plain
text, Inform 6 code, XML, and so on), writing to a variety of files, and
often need to juggle and rearrange partially written segments. These
texts tend to be structured with running indentation, and may eventually
need to be written to a disc file with either ISO Latin-1 or UTF-8
encodings, perhaps escaped for XML.

"Streams" are an abstraction to make it easy to handle all of this. The
writer to a stream never needs to know where the text will come out, or how
it should be indented or encoded.

Moreover, streams unify text files and strings, and can hold arbitrary
Unicode text. This text is encoded internally as a sequence of 32-bit Unicode
code points, in a form we might call semi-composed, in that all possible
compositions of ISO Latin-1 characters are made: e.g., E plus acute accent
is composed to a single code point as E-acute.

We give just one character value a non-Unicode meaning:

@d NEWLINE_IN_STRING ((char) 0x7f) /* Within quoted text, all newlines are converted to this */

@ The |text_stream| type began as a generalisation of the standard C library's
|FILE|, and it is used in mostly similar ways. The user -- the whole
program outside of this section -- deals only with |text_stream *| pointers to
represent streams in use.

All stream handling is defined via macros. While many operations could be
handled by ordinary functions, others cannot. |text_stream| cannot have exactly
the semantics of |FILE| since we cannot rely on the host operating system
to allocate and deallocate the structures behind |text_stream *| pointers; and
we cannot use our own memory system, either, since we need stream handling
to work both before the memory allocator starts and after it has finished.
Our macros allow us to hide all this. Besides that, a macro approach makes it
easier to retrofit new implementations as necessary. (The present
implementation is the second stab at it.)

@ We'll define a few variadic macros here, because there are awkward issues
with code ordering if we leave them until later. They are written in the
old-fashioned way, for compatibility with old copies of GCC, and avoid the
need for comma deletion around empty tokens, as that is a point of
incompatibility between implementations of the C preprocessor |cpp|. All the
same, if you're porting this code, you may need to rewrite the macro with
|...| in place of |args...| in the header, and then |__VA_ARGS__| in place
of |args| in the definition: that being the modern way, apparently.

|WRITE| is essentially |sprintf| and |fprintf| combined, since it prints
formatted text to the current stream, which could be either a string or a
file. |PRINT| does the same but to |STDOUT|, and is thus essentially |printf|.

= (early code)
#define WRITE(args...) Writers::printf(OUT, args)

#define PRINT(args...) Writers::printf(STDOUT, args)

#define WRITE_TO(stream, args...) Writers::printf(stream, args)

#define LOG(args...) Writers::printf(DL, args)

#define LOGIF(aspect, args...) { \
	if (Log::aspect_switched_on(aspect##_DA)) Writers::printf(DL, args); \
}

@ The main purpose of many functions is to write textual material to some
file. Such functions almost always have a special argument in their
prototypes: |OUTPUT_STREAM|. This tells them where to pipe their output, which
is always to a "current stream" called |OUT|. What this leads to, and who will
see that it's properly opened and closed, are not their concern.

@d OUTPUT_STREAM text_stream *OUT /* used only as a function prototype argument */

@ Three output streams are always open. One is |NULL|, that is, its value
as a |text_stream *| pointer is |NULL|, the generic C null pointer. This represents
an oubliette: it is entirely valid to use it, but output sent to |NULL| will
never be seen again.

The others are |STDOUT| and |STDERR|. As the names suggest these are wrappers
for |stdout| and |stderr|, the standard console output and error messages
"files" provided by the C library.

We should always use |PRINT(...)| instead of |printf(...)| for console output,
so that there are no uses of |printf| anywhere in the program.

@d STDOUT Streams::get_stdout()
@d STDERR Streams::get_stderr()

@ |PUT| and |PUT_TO| similarly print single characters, which are
specified as unsigned integer values. In practice, |WRITE_TO| and
|PUT_TO| are seldom needed because there is almost always only one
stream of interest at a time -- |OUT|, the current stream.

@d PUT(c) Streams::putc(c, OUT)

@d PUT_TO(stream, c) Streams::putc(c, stream)

@ Each stream has a current indentation level, initially 0. Lines of text
will be indented by one tab stop for each level; it's an error for the level
to become negative.

@d INDENT Streams::indent(OUT);
@d STREAM_INDENT(x) Streams::indent(x);
@d OUTDENT Streams::outdent(OUT);
@d STREAM_OUTDENT(x) Streams::outdent(x);
@d SET_INDENT(N) Streams::set_indentation(OUT, N);

@ Other streams only exist when explicitly created, or "opened". A function
is only allowed to open a new stream if it can be proved that this stream will
always subsequently be "closed". (Except for the possibility of the tool
halting with an internal error, and therefore an |exit(1)|, while the stream
is still open.) A stream can be opened and closed only once, and outside that
time its state is undefined: it must not be used at all.

The simplest way is to make a temporary stream, which can be used as a sort
of clipboard. For instance, suppose we have to compile X before Y, but have to
ensure Y comes before X in the eventual output. We create a temporary stream,
compile X into it, then compile Y to |OUT|, then copy the temporary stream
into |OUT| and dispose of it.

Temporary streams are always created in memory, held in C's local stack frame
rather than allocated and freed via |malloc| and |free|. It must always be
possible to prove that execution passes from |TEMPORARY_TEXT| to
|DISCARD_TEXT|, unless the program makes a fatal exit in between. The stream,
let's call it |TEMP|, exists only between those macros. We can legitimately
create a temporary stream many times in one function (for instance inside a
loop body) because each time |TEMP| is created as a new stream, overwriting the
old one. |TEMP| is a different stream each time it is created, so it does
not violate the rule that every stream is opened and closed once only.

@d TEMPORARY_TEXT(T)
	inchar32_t T##_dest[2048];
	text_stream T##_stream_structure = Streams::new_buffer(2048, T##_dest);
	text_stream *T = &T##_stream_structure;

@d DISCARD_TEXT(T)
	STREAM_CLOSE(T);

@ Otherwise we can create new globally existing streams, provided we take on
the responsibility for seeing that they are properly closed. There are two
choices: a stream in memory, allocated via |malloc| and freed by |free| when
the stream is closed; or a file written to disc, opened via |fopen| and
later closed by |fclose|. Files are always written in text mode, that is,
|"w"| not |"wb"|, for those platforms where this makes a difference.

We use streams to handle all of our text file output, so there should be no
calls to |fprintf| anywhere in the program except for binary files.

@d STREAM_OPEN_TO_FILE(new, fn, enc) Streams::open_to_file(new, fn, enc)

@d STREAM_OPEN_TO_FILE_APPEND(new, fn, enc) Streams::open_to_file_append(new, fn, enc)

@d STREAM_OPEN_IN_MEMORY(new) Streams::open_to_memory(new, 20480)

@d STREAM_CLOSE(stream) Streams::close(stream)

@ The following operation is equivalent to |fflush| and makes it more likely
(I put it no higher) that the text written to a stream has all actually been
copied onto the disc, rather than sitting in some operating system buffer.
This helps ensure that any debugging log is up to the minute, in case of
a crash, but its absence wouldn't hurt our normal function. Flushing
a memory stream is legal but does nothing.

@d STREAM_FLUSH(stream) Streams::flush(stream)

@ A piece of information we can read for any stream is the number of characters
written to it: its "extent". In fact, UTF-8 multi-byte encoding schemes,
together with differing platform interpretations of C's |'\n'|, mean that this
extent is not necessarily either the final file size in bytes or the final
number of human-readable characters. We will only actually use it to detect
whether text has, or has not, been written to a stream between two points in
time, by seeing whether or not it has increased.

@d STREAM_EXTENT(x) Streams::get_position(x)

@ The remaining operations are available only for streams in memory (well, and
for |NULL|, but of course they do nothing when applied to that). While they
could be provided for file streams, this would be so inefficient that we will
pretend it is impossible. Any function which might need to use one
of these operations should open with the following sentinel macro:

@d STREAM_MUST_BE_IN_MEMORY(x)
	if ((x != NULL) && (x->write_to_memory == NULL))
		internal_error("text_stream not in memory");

@ First, we can erase one or more recently written characters:

@d STREAM_BACKSPACE(x) Streams::set_position(x, Streams::get_position(x) - 1)

@d STREAM_ERASE_BACK_TO(start_position) Streams::set_position(OUT, start_position)

@ Second, we can look at the text written. The minimal form is to look at
just the most recent character, but we can also copy one entire memory
stream into another stream (where the target can be either a memory or file
stream).

@d STREAM_MOST_RECENT_CHAR(x) Streams::latest(x)

@d STREAM_COPY(to, from) Streams::copy(to, from)

@ So much for the definition; now the implementation.

Here is the |text_stream| structure. Open memory streams are represented by
structures where |write_to_memory| is valid, open file streams by those where
|write_to_file| is valid. That counts every open stream except |NULL|, which
of course doesn't point to a |text_stream| structure at all.

Any stream can have |USES_XML_ESCAPES_STRF| set or cleared. When this is set, the
XML (and HTML) escapes of |&amp;| for ampersand, and |&lt;| and |&gt;| for
angle brackets, will be used automatically on writing. By default this flag
is clear, that is, no conversion is made.

@ A theological question: what is the text encoding for the null stream?

@d STREAM_USES_UTF8(x) ((x)?((x->stream_flags) & FILE_ENCODING_UTF8_STRF):FALSE)

@ When text is stored at |write_to_memory|, it is kept as a zero-terminated C
wide string, with one word per Unicode code point. It turns out to be
efficient to preserve a small margin of clear space at the end of the space,
so out of the |chars_capacity| space, the following amount will be kept clear:

@d SPACE_AT_END_OF_STREAM 6

@ A statistic we keep, since it costs little:

@h Initialising the stream structure.
Note that the following fills in sensible defaults for every field, but the
result is not a valid open stream; it's a blank form ready to be filled in.

By default the upper limit on file size is 2 GB. It's very hard to see this
ever being approached for any tool associated with the Inform project, where
text files have a size which is proportionate to the result of human writing.
The only output file with a sorceror's-apprentice-like ability to grow and
grow is the debugging file, and if it should reach 2 GB then it deserves to be
truncated and we will shed no tears.

@h Converting from C strings.
We then have three ways to open a stream whose initial contents are given
by a C string. First, a wide string (a sequence of 32-bit Unicode code
points, null terminated):

}

@ Similarly, an ISO string (a sequence of 8-bit code points in the first
page of the Unicode set, null terminated):

=
int Streams::open_from_ISO_string(text_stream *stream, const char *c_string) {
	if (stream == NULL) internal_error("tried to open NULL stream");

void Streams::write_ISO_string(text_stream *stream, const char *c_string) {
	for (int i=0; c_string[i]; i++) Streams::putci(c_string[i], stream);
}

@ Finally, a UTF-8 encoded C string:

=
int Streams::open_from_UTF8_string(text_stream *stream, const char *c_string) {
	if (stream == NULL) internal_error("tried to open NULL stream");
	int capacity = (c_string)?((int) strlen(c_string)):0;

@ The following is checked before any numerical |printf|-style escape is expanded
into the stream, or before any single character is written. Thus we cannot
overrun our buffers unless the expansion of a numerical escape exceeds
|SPACE_AT_END_OF_STREAM| plus 1 in size. Since no outside influence gets to
choose what formatting escapes we use (so that |%3000d|, say, can't occur),
we can be pretty confident.

The interesting case occurs when we run out of memory in a memory stream.
We make a continuation to a fresh |text_stream| structure, which points to twice
as much memory as the original, allocated via |malloc|. (We will actually need
a little more memory than that because we also have to make room for the
|text_stream| structure itself.) We then set |stream| to the |continuation|. Given
that |malloc| was successful -- and it must have been or we would have stopped
with a fatal error -- the continuation is guaranteed to be large enough,
since it's twice the size of the original, which itself was large enough to
hold any escape sequence when opened.

@<Ensure there is room to expand the escape sequence into@> =
	if (stream->chars_written + SPACE_AT_END_OF_STREAM >= stream->chars_capacity) {
		if (stream->write_to_file) return; /* write nothing further */
		if (stream->write_to_memory) {
			int offset = (32 + 2*(stream->chars_capacity))*((int) sizeof(inchar32_t));
			int needed = offset + ((int) sizeof(text_stream)) + 32;
			void *further_allocation = Memory::malloc(needed, STREAM_MREASON);
			if (further_allocation == NULL) Errors::fatal("Out of memory");
			text_stream *continuation = (text_stream *) (further_allocation + offset);
			Streams::initialise(continuation, FOR_CO_STRF);
			continuation->write_to_memory = further_allocation;
			continuation->chars_capacity = 2*stream->chars_capacity;
			(continuation->write_to_memory)[0] = 0;
			stream->stream_continues = continuation;

	for (i=0; p[i]; i++) Streams::putci(p[i], stream);
	if (x) stream->stream_flags += USES_XML_ESCAPES_STRF;
}

@ Shifting indentation. For every indent there must be an equal and opposite
outdent, but error conditions can cause some compilation routines to issue
problem messages and then leave what they're doing incomplete, so we will
be a little cautious about assuming that a mismatch means an error.

=
void Streams::indent(text_stream *stream) {
	if (stream == NULL) return;
	stream->stream_flags += INDENTATION_BASE_STRF;

		return;
	}
	stream->stream_flags -= INDENTATION_BASE_STRF;
}

void Streams::set_indentation(text_stream *stream, int N) {
	if (stream == NULL) return;
	int B = stream->stream_flags & INDENTATION_MASK_STRF;
	stream->stream_flags -= B;
	stream->stream_flags += N*INDENTATION_BASE_STRF;
}

@ We can read the position for any stream, including |NULL|, but no matter
how much is written to |NULL| this position never budges.

Because of continuations, this is not as simple as returning the |chars_written|
field.

=
int Streams::get_position(text_stream *stream) {
	int t = 0;
	while (stream) {
		t += stream->chars_written;
		stream = stream->stream_continues;
	}
	return t;
}

@h Memory-stream-only functions.
While it would be easy enough to implement this for file streams too, there's
no point, since it is used only in concert with backspacing.

=
int Streams::latest(text_stream *stream) {
	if (stream == NULL) return 0;
	if (stream->write_to_file) internal_error("stream_latest on file stream");
	while ((stream->stream_continues) && (stream->stream_continues->chars_written > 0))
		stream = stream->stream_continues;
	if (stream->write_to_memory) {
		if (stream->chars_written > 0)
			return (int) ((stream->write_to_memory)[stream->chars_written - 1]);
	}
	return 0;
}

@ Accessing characters by index. Note that the stream terminates at the first
zero byte found, so that putting a zero truncates it.

	if (stream == NULL) internal_error("examining null stream");
	if (stream->write_to_file) internal_error("examining file stream");
	while (position >= stream->chars_written) {
		position = position - stream->chars_written;
		stream = stream->stream_continues;
		if (stream == NULL) return 0;
	}
	if (stream->write_to_memory == NULL) return 0;
	return (stream->write_to_memory)[position];
}

void Streams::put_char_at_index(text_stream *stream, int position, inchar32_t C) {
	if (stream == NULL) internal_error("modifying null stream");
	if (stream->write_to_file) internal_error("modifying file stream");
	if (stream->stream_flags & READ_ONLY_STRF) internal_error("modifying read-only stream");
	while (position >= stream->chars_written) {
		position = position - stream->chars_written;
		stream = stream->stream_continues;

		stream->chars_written = position;
		if (stream->stream_continues) {
			Streams::close(stream->stream_continues);
			stream->stream_continues = NULL;
		}
	}
}

@ Now for what is the trickiest function, because the position may be moved back
so that later continuations fall away. This will very rarely happen, so we
won't worry about the inefficiency of freeing up the memory saved by closing
such continuation blocks (which would be inefficient if we immediately had
to open similar ones again).

=
void Streams::set_position(text_stream *stream, int position) {
	if (stream == NULL) return;
	if (position < 0) position = 0; /* to simplify the implementation of backspacing */
	if (stream->write_to_file) internal_error("stream_set_position on file stream");
	if (stream->stream_flags & READ_ONLY_STRF) internal_error("modifying read-only stream");
	if (stream->write_to_memory) {
		while (position > stream->chars_written) {
			position = position - stream->chars_written;
			stream = stream->stream_continues;
			if (stream == NULL) internal_error("can't set position forwards");
		}
		stream->chars_written = position;
		(stream->write_to_memory)[stream->chars_written] = 0;
		if (stream->stream_continues) {
			Streams::close(stream->stream_continues);
			stream->stream_continues = NULL;
		}
	}
}

@ Lastly, our copying function, where |from| has to be a memory stream (or
|NULL|) but |to| can be anything (including |NULL|).

=
void Streams::copy(text_stream *to, text_stream *from) {
	if ((from == NULL) || (to == NULL)) return;

			inchar32_t c = (from->write_to_memory)[i];
